This project re-packages [`@keycloak/keycloak-account-ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@keycloak/keycloak-account-ui).  
All credits goes to the keycloak team for the original work. Mainly [@jonkoops
](https://github.com/jonkoops) and [@edewit](https://github.com/edewit).

This re-packaged distribution serves two key purposes:

1. **Ensuring retro-compatibility with Keycloak**:  
   It allows the Account UI to work seamlessly with older versions of Keycloak (down to version 19) and future major versions. This enables you to create a custom Account UI with minimal maintenance, without worrying about which Keycloak version it will be deployed on.

2. **Enabling partial customization of the Account UI**:  
   You can take ownership of specific parts of the Account UI by simply copying and modifying [source files](https://unpkg.com/browse/@keycloakify/keycloak-account-ui@26.0.0-rc.1/src/) as needed. The rest of the UI can remain in the original module, so your codebase will only include the files you've customized.

> **Note:** This package's GitHub repository does not contain any code as it is automatically generated at build time by [scripts/prepare.ts](/scripts/prepare.ts).  
> You can browse the sources includes int the NPM package [here](https://unpkg.com/browse/@keycloakify/keycloak-account-ui@26.0.0-rc.1/src/).
